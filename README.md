# BookList

Just for getting my feet wet with redux.

## Howto
- JSON Mock sever: npm run mock:server

## TODOS
- Update ngrx to match Angular version when available

## Questions

## ngrx Version
- Angular version 21
- ngrx version 20
  - installed `@ngrx/store-devtools@^20.1.0`with option `--legacy-peer-deps`
Any problems expected? At this time `store-devtools` [documentation](https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools)
is not available too, but it still seems to work.

### Store Dev Tools
- installed in `devDependencies`
- provided in `app.config.ts`
Do we run into production build problems the way it is configured now?
